    A binary tres is called a tree node should have less then or equls to 2 degree. Ex:- a node should have {0,1,2} childs

    1. Find the maximum number of possible binary tree using Catalon number : 2nCn/(n+1)
    2. Find the maximum hight binary tree count                             : 2^n-1
    3. Finding the minimum number of nodes in binary tree if hieght given   : h+1
    4. Finding the maximum no of nodes in Binary tree using GP Series       : 2^h+1 - 1
    5. Finding the minimim hight of the binary tree if node given           : Log(n+1) - 1
    6. Finding the maximum hight of the binary tree if node givent          : n-1
       Internal vs External nodes
    7. Finding the degree 0 nodes or leaf nodes from tree            Deg(0) : Deg(2) + 1
    8. Strict/Proper/Complete Binary Tree
        Strict Binary tree means a node should have either 0 or 2 children. And it should
        not have 1 childern.
